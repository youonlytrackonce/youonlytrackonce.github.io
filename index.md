## Abstract

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have enabled significant progress in computer vision applications including pedestrian detection and tracking as well. Even though CNNs are widely utilized, there are still open questions regarding suitable architectures and training data. In the field of multi object tracking (MOT), track by detection paradigm has been a common approach due to the success of one-shot object detectors in the last years. In this study we focus on in-depth analyses of well performing four multi-object trackers to observe the weak and strong sides for real-world applications such as surveillance. For this purpose as well as contribute the literature, we introduce \textit{TrackEverySeason}, a new set of multi person tracking data with annotated short video shots captured from static cameras located on poles with 6-8 meter height positioned for city surveillance. This provides a more focused and specified benchmarking of MOT for outdoor surveillance compared to public MOT datasets which are mostly dedicated to autonomous driving problem and their view angle is on waistline except MOT20\cite{mot20} and PETS\cite{PETS2009} datasets. Moreover, static camera configuration also enables to conduct experiments on background modelling techniques.
